[SPEECH]

Dear Members,
Ladies and gentlemen,

I am extremely pleased to present the company’s performance for the financial year.
Despite unprecedented global challenges and market volatility, our organization has
demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth.

Management is confident that the strategic initiatives undertaken during the year
have positioned the company strongly for the future. Temporary timing differences
in revenue recognition and cost alignment should not be misinterpreted, as these
adjustments are operational in nature.

We firmly believe that our fundamentals remain exceptionally strong, and we expect
continued value creation for our stakeholders. Any concerns raised externally are
largely speculative and do not reflect the true long-term potential of the business.

We remain committed to transparency, governance, and sustainable growth.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.



[REPORT]

The company experienced significant volatility in earnings during the financial year.
Certain revenue streams were reclassified in accordance with revised accounting
interpretations and evolving regulatory guidance.

Management acknowledges delays in vendor payments and adjustments in provisioning
for doubtful receivables. These changes were necessary to reflect operational realities
and liquidity constraints during the period.

Internal controls and reporting processes were reviewed. While no material weaknesses
were formally identified, procedural enhancements and additional oversight mechanisms
are currently under consideration.

Future performance will depend on market conditions, regulatory clarity, successful
execution of corrective initiatives, and the company’s ability to manage financial
and operational risks. Stakeholders are advised to exercise caution when interpreting
year-on-year performance comparisons.
